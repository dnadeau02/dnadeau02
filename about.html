<body class="main">
    <p class="about"> The Main reason I had chose to create such a webiste <br> Is because , I myself Is a Marvel Fan
        and
        wanted to also <br> dig deeper Into somethings I had questions about such as <br> "How much was the profit of
        each of the
        most popular <br> movies In the MCU" and also what Comic they originated <br> from. I enjoy wathing these movies
        because
        of the color It <br> brings to the screen and the amount of effort put In each <br> and everyone of these
        high-grossing
        movies. This website <br> was also made to give Information to people who needed <br> some question's anwsered.
        It was
        also made to bring to <br> light where all these great movies originally <br> came from and what they were based
        on.</p>

    <p class="about">This wouldn't be possible without the man himself Stan Lee <br> , Creator of many of some of my favorite
        superheros to ever <br> be. The way he created a life around each and every one of <br> them Is truly facisinating because
        It can lead you to sometimes <br> relate to a certain character and that right there Is what kick <br> starts an adventure
        with that story and gets you intrigued and <br> makes you continue to read and watch the story <br> unfold to a greater
        meaning.</p>
